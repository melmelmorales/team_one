# What is the Interplay between Chronic Internet Usage, Position on the Political Spectrum, and Broader Trust in Authority?
For these questions, we reviewed variables encompassing Trust for various authority figures (police, politicians, legal system, and parliament), daily internet usage in minutes, and position on the political spectrum. We excluded all non-numerical and null values in each review. Variable scale is included below.
