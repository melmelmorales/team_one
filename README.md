# What is the Interplay between Chronic Internet Usage, Position on the Political Spectrum, and Broader Trust in Authority?
For these questions, we reviewed variables encompassing Trust for various authority figures (police, politicians, legal system, and parliament), daily internet usage in minutes, and position on the political spectrum. We excluded all non-numerical and null values in each review. Variable scale is included below.

## Is high internet usage a predictor of political leanings?
We see a strong correlation between interent usage and political ideologies, with an r-value of -0.889. In other words, as respondents self-reported as more conservative, we saw their internet usage time decrease by over 20% at its lowest. This decrease is relatively consistent over the political scale, with one exception. Those who self-reported as most conservative responded that their internet usage was much higher than all their conservative peers.

On ther other hand, when graphing internet usage vs turst in an authority figure - here the legal system, we saw only a moderate correlation(r-value: 0.447) between the two. Here now we see a spike at either end of the data, showing that those who spend the most time online have both the least and most trust in their countries legal system.

## How is trust in authority affected by political ideology? 
Since the left to right scale yielded our highest correlatio prior we focus on that as our metric.
